# Leeds-Butterfly-Image-Classification
Data Science Course Project 

Description:<br/>
Classification of ten butterfly species from the Leeds butterfly dataset with VGG16+CNN.

Dataset:
This dataset contains images and textual descriptions for ten categories (species) of butterflies.

The image dataset comprises 832 images in total, with the distribution ranging from 55 to 100 images per category. Images were collected from Google Images by querying with the scientific (Latin) name of the species, for example "Danaus plexippus", and manually filtered for those depicting the butterfly of interest.

The textual descriptions for each butterfly category were obtained from the eNature online nature guide.
